### 4. CLINK Lockers™ (Physical Network)

| Factor | ChinaLink Express | sd-aircargo | Barrier for sd-aircargo |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Locker Hardware** | Installing 50+ units | None | $60K+ for pilot |
| **Real Estate Contracts** | Securing prime locations | None | Competition for locations |

### 5. CLINK Platform™ (API Ecosystem)

| Factor | ChinaLink Express | sd-aircargo | Barrier for sd-aircargo |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|

```
Developer Platform Moat:

Developers integrate with ONE platform per category
Because: Time investment, learning curve, switching costs

If ChinaLink achieves:
- 20 integrations in Year 1
- 50 integrations in Year 2  
- 100+ integrations in Year 3

Developers won't build for sd-aircargo because:
1. Small user base (why support two platforms?)
2. ChinaLink API already works
3. No incentive to switch

Network effect: More integrations → More users → More integrations
```

---

## Compound Moat Analysis

### The Real Power: Combined Effect

Even if sd-aircargo somehow copies ONE feature, they cannot copy the **ecosystem**:

```
ChinaLink Customer Journey:

Step 1: Use AI to find optimal shipping time
        ↓ (CLINK Intelligence - cannot copy)
Step 2: Buy from verified suppliers at discount  
        ↓ (CLINK Network - cannot copy)
Step 3: Get financing to make purchase
        ↓ (CLINK Credit - cannot copy)
Step 4: Pick up from nearby locker
        ↓ (CLINK Lockers - cannot copy)
Step 5: Manage via API in their business system
        ↓ (CLINK Platform - cannot copy)
        
Result: Customer is LOCKED IN
Switching cost: EXTREMELY HIGH

sd-aircargo alternative:
Step 1: Call for quote (no AI)
Step 2: Find own suppliers (no network)  
Step 3: Pay cash upfront (no financing)
Step 4: Wait for delivery (no lockers)
Step 5: Manual tracking (no API)

Result: Basic service only
Competitive advantage: NONE
```
