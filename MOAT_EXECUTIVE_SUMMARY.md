- Supplier trust
- Market learning
- **You can't buy time.**

## The "Untouchable" Formula

```
1. LOCK IN customers  →  Guarantees + Rewards + Switching Costs
2. LOCK OUT rivals    →  Network Effects + Data + Infrastructure  
3. LOCK UP market     →  Regulatory + Brand

Result = Market Dominance
```

## Competitive Position

### Current State
- ChinaLink: 7+ years, mobile app, multi-country presence
- SD AIR CARGO: Copying features, basic website

### 24-Month Vision
- ChinaLink: **40%+ market share, premium pricing, dominant brand**
- SD AIR CARGO: Price competitor with no differentiation

---

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Approve $50,000 Q1 budget** for quick wins
2. **Assign project owners** to each moat type
3. **Launch guarantee program** within 30 days
4. **Begin data collection** immediately
5. **Start IATA certification** application

---

## The Bottom Line

**If we implement 60% of this strategy:**
- SD AIR CARGO becomes irrelevant
- We command premium pricing
- New entrants can't compete
- We own the China-Mali corridor

**The question isn't whether to do this.**  
**The question is how fast can we execute.**
